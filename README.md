# Wordpress-Jaytheme
This is a simple Wordpress page built for educational purposes. I ended up doing an OOP exercise and creating a tournament module. I used Advanced Custom Fields to allow the wp-admin to easily create new "Heroes" with attributes using the wp-admin interface and then users can select which "Heroes" they'd like in the tournament.
